# Simple Microservice Go

## Description
The purpose of this script is to explore the different features offered by Go-Kit to build a microservice. This particular command line application, offers a service where it takes in a string input and converts it into uppercase. While there is not much going on here, this project helped me learn the nitty gritty parts of Go-Kit and this knowledge is being used to build a full fledged set of microservices which you can find here.
